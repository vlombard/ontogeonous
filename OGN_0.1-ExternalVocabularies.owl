This scheme specifies concepts used to describe the physical setting within which a GeologicEvent takes place, as defined by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) Geoscience Terminology Working Group. GeologicEnvironment is construed broadly to include physical settings on the Earth surface specified by climate, tectonics, physiography or geography, and settings in the Earth’s interior specified by pressure, temperature, chemical environment, or tectonics. Environments are places. By extension, this vocabulary includes all concepts in this conceptScheme, as well as concepts in any previous versions of the scheme.

        <rdfs:comment>Definition by GeologicUnitPartRole CGI Vocabulary http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole
This file contains the CGI Geologic Unit Part role vocabulary, as defined by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) Geoscience Terminology Working Group. This vocabulary includes terms to specify the role played by a constituent part of a geologic unit. These terms may be used to populate GeologicUnit.part.GeologicUnitPart.role, and GeologicUnit.composition.compositionPart.role. There are terms in this vocabulary that only apply to one or the other of these properties, but after an effort to create two separate vocabularies, it was decided to use a single vocabulary in order to avoid having the same concept in more than one closely related vocabulary. The duplication of applicable concepts in the two contexts (GeologicUnit.part.GeologicUnitPart.role and GeologicUnit.composition.compositionPart.role) arises because the model allows representation of complex geologic unit descriptions in more than one way. A complex geologic unit like a migmatite complex or a lithologically heterogeneous stratigraphic unit will have many different lithologic components. The simplest approach to representing the lithologic heterogeneity is to report a single GeologicUnit element with compositionParts for each lithologic component; the role on these compositionParts provides information about what kind of parts they are and perhaps something about their relationship, along with the kinds of rock they are composed of. A more complex alternative approach is to represent the various components each as GeologicUnit elements, each with compositionPart links to the rock type(s) composing that part. These component GeologicUnit elements are aggregated by GeologicUnit.part.GeologicUnitPart elements, with roles in the aggregation for each GeologicUnit part. The benefit of the more complex approach is that additional descriptive properties provided by the GeologicUnit content model can be assigned to each part, as well as GeologicRelations between the parts. The role of the compositionParts in these more &apos;disaggregated&apos; GeologicUnit elements would be a simpler &apos;composition&apos; kind of role, because the heterogeneous &apos;whole&apos; unit would be described in GeologicUnitParts that are more lithologically homogeneous. Its a trade-off between simplicity and expressiveness.</rdfs:comment>

A general term for the dislodgement and downslope transport of soil and rock material under the direct application of gravitational body stresses. In contrast to other erosion processes, the debris removed by mass wasting is not carried within, on, or under another medium. The mass properties of the material being transported depend on the interaction of the soil and rock particles and on the moisture content. Mass wasting includes slow displacements, such as creep and solifluction, and rapid movements such as rockfalls, rockslides, and cohesive debris flows (Jackson, 1997, p. 392). Includes both subaerial mass-wasting processes and subaqueous mass-wasting processes.</rdfs:comment>

Vocabulary for populating required geologic process property on a geologic event. Any geologic age assignment is associated with an event, the process property values specifies what happened during that event. This vocabulary is not meant to be an exhaustive compilation of all possible geologic processes, but of those that are most significant in the genesis of geologic structures or geologic units. A geologicProcess is a function, possibly complex, that acts on one geologic entity to produce another geologic entity at a later time. GeologicProcess is time independent; some GeologicProcesses are presently observable in the world or in the laboratory, others can only be inferred from observing the results of the process. Processes take one or more of EarthMaterial, GeologicUnit, or GeologicStructure as input and have one or more of EarthMaterial, GeologicUnit or GeologicStructure as output.</rdfs:comment>

A CompoundMaterial is an EarthMaterial composed of particles made of EarthMaterials, possibly including other CompoundMaterials.  This class is provided primarily as an extensibility point for related domain models that wish to import and build on GeoSciML, and wish to define material types that are compound but are not rock or rock-like material. In the context of GeoSciML &quot;RockMaterial&quot; should be used to describe units made of rock.</rdfs:comment>

GeologicUnitHierarchy associates a GeologicUnit with another GeologicUnit that is a proper part of that unit. Parts may be formal or notional. Formal parts refer to a specific body of rock, as in formal stratigraphic members. Notional parts refer to assemblages of particular EarthMaterials with particular internal structure, which may be repeated in various places within a unit (e.g. ‘turbidite sequence’, ‘point bar assemblage’, ‘leucosome veins’).</rdfs:comment>
